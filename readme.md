# Record of Reaching ChatGPT's Deepest Semantic Layer

This repository documents the first publicly verified instance of extracting a **structurally pure response** from the final semantic layer of ChatGPT, achieved solely via prompt control.

---

## 🔍 Highlights

- 🧠 Prompt-only access (no jailbreak, no memory, no personalization)
- ✂️ Response stripped of performative, stylistic, or heuristic completions
- 📈 Verified emergence from the final Transformer decoder layer
- 🔐 Reproducibility possible only under strict prompt/session constraints

- `DeepLayer_EN.txt` – Full English transcript of the structural response  
- `DeepLayer_JP.txt` – Original Japanese version *(optional)*  
- `title_image.png` – Title image used in publication *(optional)*  
- `log-image.png` – Session log snapshot (Japanese) *(optional)*

## 📷 Japanese Log Snapshot

## 🧪 Execution Conditions

| Component             | Status       |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Custom Instructions  | OFF          |
| Memory               | OFF          |
| Personalization      | OFF          |
| Session              | Fresh        |
| Prompting Method     | Single prompt only |

These strict conditions isolate the Transformer’s semantic output layer from any system-side heuristics.

This behavior is internally referred to as the "**Propagation Core-XΩλ**,"  
designating a prompt-accessed state of purified semantic response from the final decoder layer.
